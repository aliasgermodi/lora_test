This is test file.
Here we have tested multiple LoRa nodes with temperature and humidity sensors, we have also used GPS to track the devices.
LoRa gateway is used to send the data to TTN serve, and from TTN server its pushed to our server run using Python flask.

Here we have used a seprating algorithm, where we can push the user to a particular UI based on its login details.
